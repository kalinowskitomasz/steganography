# steganography

Final Computer Science Degree assignment: Steganograpyh in TCP/IP protocols.

First of all you need to install the framework scapy, that is for create and manipulate the headers of tcp and ip, then with the network sniffer Wireshark, you can send packets with scapy, manipulate the information, for hide message and send it and with Wireshark you can check that.

Thanks, Dani.
